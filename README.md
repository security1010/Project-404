# Missing Persons Finder App

Welcome to the private collaboration space for the **Missing Persons Finder App** – a project by Dom and the team, dedicated to making a positive impact in The Gambia.  

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Missing Persons Finder App is designed to be a **comprehensive platform** for tracking, reporting, and locating missing persons. By combining a centralized database, AI-powered features, and community-driven engagement, the project aims to improve response times, increase recovery rates, and enhance public safety.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Centralized Database:** Detailed profiles of missing persons, including photos, last known locations, age, and physical traits.
  
- **Reporting & Verification:** Secure reporting options, with verification to prevent false reports and support for anonymous tips.
  
- **Search & Discovery:** Advanced search tools, map integration, and last-seen location tracking.
  
- **3D Reconstruction & Image Enhancement:** AI-generated 3D models from photos (even blurry or partial), with age progression and overlays (e.g., hats, glasses).
  
- **Community Alerts:** Real-time notifications and social media integration to spread awareness faster.
  
- **Incentive/Bounty System:** Optional rewards for verified tips that lead to successful recoveries.
  
- **Case Tracking:** Timelines for each case, viewable by families and authorities.
  
- **Advanced AI Features:** Facial recognition, pattern matching, and predictive analytics to support investigations.
